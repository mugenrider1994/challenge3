# challenge3 Random Password Generator

## Motivation
I did this challenge to expand my skillset with javascript. I was able to implement prompts to get user input for criteria wanted for a random password generator. I was able to work on if statements and for loops to make sure each character was an option for a chosen randomized character.

## Description
This password generator will make a random password for the user. The user will go through a series of prompts that will ask if they would like to include a length between 8 and 128 characters, numbers, lowercase, uppercase and special characters. Once the user has gone through the prompts, a random password will be generated and will display in the text box.


## Contributing
If you would like, make a while loop for the upperCase, lowerCase, specialCharacters and numbers to ensure that only y or n can be used to input.

## Project Status
One may feel the need to insert a while loop to make sure y/n are the only characters used to input in the prompt and display a message to the user when they have input a different character.
